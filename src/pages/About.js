                <h1><span className="highlight">About Me 🌟</span></h1>
                 <p>
                I’m a <span className="bold">front-end software engineer</span> with a passion for building sleek,
                engaging, and <span className="bold">intuitive digital experiences</span>. My background spans 
                <span className="bold">engineering</span>, accounting, teaching, and <span className="bold">design</span>, giving me a unique 
                mix  of analytical problem-solving and creative thinking that I 
                bring into my work. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I started my software engineering journey as a 
                self-taught developer, fueled by curiosity and a love for tech. Over 
                the years, I’ve worked on <span className="bold">full-stack applications</span>, <span className="bold">UX/UI design</span>, and 
                <span className="bold"> QA automation</span>, constantly pushing myself to learn, build, and 
                refine. Right now, I’m focused on leveling up my skills, sharing my 
                work on <span className="bold">GitHub</span>, and expanding my professional network.
                </p>
                <p>
                Outside of 
                tech, I’m always <span className="bold">learning</span> and <span className="bold">creating</span>—whether it’s baking macarons, 
                designing, painting, or picking up new skills just for fun. I also 
                spend a lot of time swimming, biking, paddleboarding, and exploring 
                the outdoors.
